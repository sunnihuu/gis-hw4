PROVENANCE / CODE SOURCES
Assignment 04 — Representation & Interactivity  

Basemap
The basemap style was created in Maputnik using custom layer and color adjustments.  
The map uses Protomaps tiles and glyphs via Protomaps API key.  
The tile and glyph URLs were added manually, and the map center/zoom were set to NYC.

Data
The dataset (“Ghost_Bikes_with_google_coords.csv”) comes from my compiled ghost bike point data from hw 2 02 Making Data + Narrative Building.  
PapaParse was used (via its documentation) to load the CSV in the browser, and the data was converted into a GeoJSON-like structure for MapLibre.

Map & Interaction
The project follows MapLibre GL JS documentation for setting up the map, sources, and layers.  
Circle and label layers were added for the ghost bike points, with hover and click interactions.  
Time-range filtering and borough filtering use MapLibre’s `setFilter()` with combined expressions.

UI
The HTML/CSS layout is kept simple and lightweight so the map can be explored easily on its own.

LLM Use
ChatGPT / VS Code AI was used only for debugging help (e.g., API key issues, filter syntax) and for wording this PROVENANCE note.  
No complete code blocks were copied without modification or understanding.
