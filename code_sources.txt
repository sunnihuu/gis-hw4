Basemap
The basemap style was created in Maputnik with custom layer and color adjustments.
The map uses Protomaps tiles and glyphs via a Protomaps API key.
Tile and glyph URLs were added manually, and the map center/zoom were set to NYC.
I attempted to link my exported style.json directly into MapLibre, but due to unresolved path and asset-loading issues, I was not able to load the style successfully. I instead rebuilt the needed basemap properties manually in the JavaScript setup.

Data
The dataset (Ghost_Bikes_with_google_coords.csv) is my compiled ghost bike point data from HW02 Making Data + Narrative Building.
PapaParse (following its documentation) was used to load the CSV in the browser, and the data was converted into a GeoJSON-like structure for MapLibre.

Map & Interaction
The project follows MapLibre GL JS documentation for setting up the map, sources, and layers.
Circle and label layers were added for the ghost bike points, with hover and click interactions.
Time-range and borough filtering use MapLibre’s setFilter() with combined expressions.

UI
The HTML/CSS layout is intentionally simple and lightweight so the map can be explored without distraction.

LLM Use
ChatGPT / VS Code AI were used only for debugging support (e.g., API key errors, filter syntax) and for wording this provenance note.
No complete code blocks were copied without modification or understanding.
