Basemap
I originally created a custom basemap style in Maputnik, but I was unable to load the exported style.json into MapLibre due to unresolved asset-path and style-loading issues.
Because of this, I switched to using an open-source basemap configuration and rebuilt the necessary layer and color settings directly in my JavaScript setup.

Data
The dataset (Ghost_Bikes_with_google_coords.csv) is my compiled ghost bike point data from HW02 Making Data + Narrative Building.
PapaParse (following its documentation) was used to load the CSV in the browser, and the data was converted into a GeoJSON-like structure for MapLibre.

Map & Interaction
The project follows MapLibre GL JS documentation for setting up the map, sources, and layers.
Circle and label layers were added for the ghost bike points, with hover and click interactions.
Time-range and borough filtering use MapLibre’s setFilter() with combined expressions.

UI
The HTML/CSS layout is intentionally simple and lightweight so the map can be explored without distraction.

LLM Use
ChatGPT / VS Code AI were used only for debugging support (e.g., API key errors, filter syntax) and for wording this provenance note.
No complete code blocks were copied without modification or understanding.
